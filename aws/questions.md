1. How to choose an AWS Region? Or If you need to launch a new application where should you do it?
It depends. Factors that impact:
* **Compliance:** Data governance and legal requirements
* **Proximity to customers:** To reduce latency you would like to deploy the application close to your target users.
* **Service availability in region:** Not all services and feature available in each region.
* **Pricing:** Pricing varies region to region
