# Kubernetes

Kubernetes play two important roles
* Resource Manager
* Application orchestrator

## Resource Manager

The resources it manages are Servers.  
AWS calls them **EC2**
Azure calls them **Virtual Machines**
Google calls them **Compute Engines**


There are two way to provide instructions to kubernetes
* Imperative
  - Instructions spricify actions with details
  - Input : Commands / File
  
* Declarative
  - Instruct action and let kubernetes figure things out
  - Input: Files
